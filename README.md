on_irc
======
An event driven IRC library for the Ruby programming language.

on_irc is Ruby 1.8.7 compatible and will remain this way. If you don't require 1.8.7
compatability, [cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch) is almost certainly a better
option. However, if you're stuck on 1.8.7, on_irc might work for you.

Samples
-------
See the [examples](/examples) directory.

Dependencies
------------
on_irc uses the [eventmachine](http://rubyeventmachine.com) gem.
